    the prepared truth snapshot and complete the lease CAS. A truth writer may
    therefore commit while a backend blocks; its higher outbox event remains the
    durable repair obligation and applies after the older physical mutation.

    A direct truth drift without a newer event triggers bounded re-preparation.
    A crash after physical mutation but before completion remains safe because
    backend upsert/delete operations are idempotent by memory id.

    ``after_replay`` is skipped when no event is claimed so empty replay cannot
    trigger a full companion audit. Successful physical mutations notify
    ``on_physical_mutation`` so callers can maintain cached counts from the
    SQLite membership ledger or an indexed backend probe. Unindexed Lance
