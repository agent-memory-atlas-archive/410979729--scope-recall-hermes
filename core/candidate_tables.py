"""The candidate tables, borrowed from the owning transaction.

Candidate processing is metadata beside a claim version: ``candidate_lifecycle``
says where a candidate stands, ``candidate_evidence`` what it has heard,
``candidate_evaluations`` which questions were asked and ``work_items`` who is
asking.  This module holds the SQL every part of the lifecycle shares -- the
audience filter, the joined "is this candidate still judgeable" row, the bounded
evidence selection and the single-row moves -- so ``candidate_intake``,
``candidate_evaluations`` and ``candidate_sweeps`` each read as one job.
