# Scope Recall maintenance rules

Maintainability is a product requirement. Prefer a small, explicit change to a new framework.

- SQLite is the sole authority for facts, identity, permissions, lifecycle and evidence. Derived indexes are optional and rebuildable.
- Put behavior in one owning module. Host adapters translate requests and bind trusted identity; they do not implement another copy of Core policy.
- Extend or compose an existing implementation before adding another engine. Remove superseded production paths in the same change; preserve historical fixtures outside the shipping allowlist.
- Keep migration orchestration separate from legacy conversion, host activation and background indexing. A host integration must explicitly prove its writer/activation boundary.
- Multi-hop queries are read-only evidence joins. They must not infer identity, broaden audiences, resurrect invalid facts or promote query-time conclusions.
- Long work needs bounded stages, durable progress, idempotent retry and visible failure. Never turn unknown data into a successful migration or retry forever.
- A new public capability needs a shared contract, both applicable host surfaces, concise operator documentation and focused boundary tests. Avoid full-suite repetition without a specific reason.
- Do not add a dependency or an extensibility layer solely for hypothetical future use. Document the reason when a new durable state or abstraction is necessary.

## Release and deployment

- The canonical repository is `github.com/410979729/scope-recall-hermes`; deployable wheels are built only from its release branch, at a tagged commit (`v3.1.0rcN`), one wheel and one sha256 per tag. Never `git init` a second history or copy the tree; use `git worktree add` and remove the worktree when the task is merged.
- Production upgrades stop all target gateway/MCP/worker writers and automatic restarters FIRST (planned-stop where supported), then use `maintenance.cli package-upgrade` with an offline wheel and external backup; uv supports pip-less venvs. Follow `maintenance/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for activation/recovery. Never hot-edit `site-packages` or remove `~*` remnants as an upgrade procedure.
- After every upgrade run `maintenance.cli plan-install` / `apply-install` so the receipt and host wrapper carry the installed version, then `doctor`; receipt, `pip show` and `running-code` records disagreeing on the version is a defect.
- Operator CLIs run as `python -I -X utf8 -m scope_recall.maintenance.cli ...` from outside the source tree, so the installed package and not a checkout answers.
- One writer at a time on the release branch; other contributors deliver branches or patches. Run the tiers that own the changed files before committing, `unit` + `contract` + `packaging` before merging, `integration` + `native` before tagging.
- Every new `.py` is either in `packaging/v11-module-allowlist.json` or in `tests/` and selected by a tier in `scripts/check.py`. Files that are neither do not enter the tree.
