"""Bounded hosted-embedding request runner with a plugin-wide worker cap.

Each OpenAI-compatible embedder owns one runner. The per-object contract is:

- at most one worker thread
- at most one in-flight job
- zero queued jobs

The plugin/process contract is a separate finite permit pool. Starting a
worker requires a nonblocking acquire of one permit. A stuck underlying
SDK call keeps that permit until the vendor call actually returns, so a
later ``setup`` / repair cannot spawn an unbounded number of abandoned
workers. Excess work fails immediately instead of creating another
thread.

Python cannot forcibly kill an arbitrary SDK thread. The bound is
therefore a hard cap on live workers, not a cancellation guarantee.

A timed-out caller returns on its operation budget and never joins the
worker. The occupied per-embedder slot stays with that job until the
underlying call finishes; later callers on the same runner fail
immediately. When the stuck call later exits, that same still-open
embedder may run again without a process restart.

Terminal ``shutdown()`` only stops accepting new work and wakes an idle
worker so it can exit. It never ``join()``s the worker. Process teardown
therefore cannot block on a half-open transport.
