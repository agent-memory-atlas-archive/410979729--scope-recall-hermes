"""What version each live process actually loaded, as opposed to what is on disk.

A long-running host imports ``scope_recall`` once; after a reinstall it keeps
running the old code while every fresh worker runs the new one, and neither the
installer nor a disk-only doctor can see it.  So every process that opens a
runtime instance leaves one small record, and ``maintenance/doctor.py`` compares
the live ones against the package on disk.

Two facts are recorded because two different things go wrong:

* ``version`` -- the in-memory ``__version__``, bound at import; a mismatch
  against disk is proof of a stale process.
* ``first_record_at`` -- when this process first wrote its record, necessarily
  after it imported the package.  A package modified later than that is not
  what this process loaded, even when the version string is unchanged, which
  is the ordinary reinstall-the-same-candidate case.

Both tests are exact; neither can fire for a process that is genuinely current.
A diagnostic that cries wolf gets ignored, and the real signal with it.

Records are written at instance construction, not at import: a host adapter
registers when a conversation starts, before it recalls or captures anything.
A host with no conversation yet has no record, and "no records" means "nothing
has registered yet", not "everything is current".

Not responsible for: acting on a stale process (doctor reports, the operator
restarts), or any form of process control.
